# Configuring TLS Encryption
This Helm Chart supports multiple mechanisms for enabling encryption of data in transit. This feature is currently under active development in order to simplify the configuration of end-to-end encryption.

End-to-end encryption is currently an opt-in feature that needs to be explicitly enabled.

## Default Configuration
Currently, even though the Helm Chart defaults enable TLS encryption for the end-user, it is not enabled by default directly on the Smile CDR HTTP endpoints used internally within the cluster.

This results in the following encryption configurations between the client and Smile CDR, depending on your choice of ingress.

### Using ingress-nginx for ingress (Default)
If you have left your ingress definition to use the default of `nginx-ingress` ([See Here](./ingress.md#nginx-ingress)), encryption will be configured as follows:

* TLS encryption between client and the AWS Network Load Balancer using ACM certificate provided when configuring the ingress-nginx controller.
* TLS encryption from the NLB to the Nginx ingress controller using self-signed certificate automatically generated by the ingress controller.
* Unencrypted from the Nginx ingress controller to the Smile CDR pods.

### Using AWS Application Load Balancer for ingress
If you have set your ingress definition to use `aws-lbc-alb` ([See Here](./ingress.md#aws-load-balancer-controller)), encryption will be configured as follows:

* TLS encryption between client and the AWS Application Load Balancer using ACM certificate specified in your `Ingress` resource.
* Unencrypted from the ALB to the Smile CDR pods.

### Using Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller for ingress
If you have set your ingress definition to use `azure-agic` ([See Here](./ingress.md#azure-application-gateway-ingress-controller)), encryption is not currently supported.

## Enabling TLS

This helm chart leverages the [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) X.509 certificate controller to provision and manage any required certificates. As such, this controller is a requirement to enable TLS beyond the default configurations mentioned above.

TLS certificate generation is enabled by configuring `Issuer` and `Certificate` resources in the cluster. For convenience, the Helm Chart will create default issuers and certificates and auto-configure Smile CDR to use them. It is also possible to disable these defaults to define your own.

### Enable Default 'cluster-signed' certificates

To enable default ***end-to-end*** encryption, add the following to your `values.yaml` file.

```
tls:
  certificateIssuers:
    default:
      enabled: true
  certificates:
    default:
      enabled: true
  defaultEndpointConfig:
    enabled: true
```

??? Explanation
    #### `certificateIssuers`
    The `certificateIssuers` configuration is used to define cert-manager `Issuer` resources.
    The provided ***default*** issuer configuration will create the following resources in the same namespace as the Smile CDR deployment:

    * A *self-signed* Issuer that is used for signing the *cluster-local* Issuer that will act as the CA for this namespace.
    * A *cluster-local* Issuer that is used for signing certificates to be used by Smile CDR
        * This `Issuer` resource is designated as the default issuer for any `Certificate` resources that do not explicitly specify an `Issuer`.

    This default issuer can be used, or it can be disabled if you wish to define your own issuers.

    #### `certificates`
    The `certificates` configuration is used to define cert-manager `Certificate` resources.
    The provided ***default*** certificate configuration will create the following resources in the same namespace as the Smile CDR deployment:

    * A certificate that is used as the default for any resources auto-configured to use TLS encryption
    * A certificate that is used for enabling TLS encryption on Smile CDR HTTP Endpoint modules
        * This certificate is signed by whichever `Issuer` resource is designated as the default.
        * This `Certificate` is designated as the default for any resources auto-configured to use TLS encryption

    This default certificate can be used, or it can be disabled if you wish to define your own certificates.

    #### `defaultEndpointConfig`
    The `defaultEndpointConfig` configuration is used to set the default auto-configuration of the Smile CDR HTTP Endpoint modules.
    By enabling this option, all HTTP endpoint modules will use whichever `Certificate` is designated as the default.

    Individual modules may also be configured to use their own certificate configurations, this will override the `defaultEndpointConfig`

Simply adding the above code will result in the following encryption configurations between the client and Smile CDR, depending on your choice of ingress.

#### Using ingress-nginx for ingress (Default)
If you have left your ingress definition to use the default of `nginx-ingress` ([See Here](./ingress.md#nginx-ingress)), default end-2-end encryption will be configured as follows:

* TLS encryption between client and the AWS Network Load Balancer using ACM certificate provided when configuring the ingress-nginx controller.
* TLS encryption from the NLB to the Nginx ingress controller using self-signed certificate automatically generated by the ingress controller.
* TLS encryption from the Nginx ingress controller to the Smile CDR pods using `cluster-signed` certificate.
* Kubernetes Readiness Probes updated to use HTTPS

#### Using AWS Application Load Balancer for ingress
If you have set your ingress definition to use `aws-lbc-alb` ([See Here](./ingress.md#aws-load-balancer-controller)), default end-to-end encryption will be configured as follows:

* TLS encryption between client and the AWS Application Load Balancer using ACM certificate specified in your `Ingress` resource.
* ELB Security policy is set to a secure default that supports TLSv1.3 (`ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-FIPS-2023-04`)
* TLS encryption from the ALB to the Smile CDR pods using `cluster-signed` certificate.
* AWS ALB Health Probes configured to use HTTPS
* Smile CDR module endpoints configured as follows:
   * `tls_debug_disable_sni_check` set to true.

>**Note:** In order for the HTTPS healthchecks to work when using the AWS ALB, the disable sni check option must be set. Currently, this will result in a warning in the Smile CDR console suggesting to disable the option. This is unavoidble at this time.

These defaults may be updated via your Helm Values file. See the [Advanced Configuration](#advanced-configuration) below.

#### Using Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller for ingress
If you have set your ingress definition to use `azure-agic` ([See Here](./ingress.md#azure-application-gateway-ingress-controller)), encryption is not currently supported.

## Advanced Configuration
If the above defaults are not suitable, much of the functionality can be customized.

### Currently configurable options
The following can be updated.
>**Note:** If you need assistance while the advanced configuration documentation is still being created, please contact us.

* Create custom cluster-local issuers
* Create custom certificates
* Manually configure individual HTTP Endpoint modules to use different certificates
* Configure using mixed-schema endpoints (i.e. some endpoints use HTTPS and some use HTTP). Note that multiple Ingress resources are required for this scenario

### Currently unsupported options
* Use pre-existing cert-manager `Certificate` resources
* Use pre-existing cert-manager `Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer` resources
* Create **Let's Encrypt** `Issuer` resources
* Configure `ingress-nginx` to use `Ingress.tls` to configure its TLS termination, instead of the default `self-signed` cert
* Securely import externally provisioned certificate material
* TLS encryption on Azure

### Adding global endpoint module configurations
If you wish to set extra configurations for TLS endpoints, you may do so using the `defaultEndpointConfig` configuration like so:

```
tls:
  defaultEndpointConfig:
    extraCdrConfig:
      tls.protocol.cipher_blacklist: "cipher1,cipher2"
```

In the above example, maybe you wish to set specific TLS cipher restrictions. By adding the configuration here, you do not need to manually add it to every endpoint module. This allows for simple configuration of TLS endpoints with reduced complexity and scope for errors. More information on available cipher/protocol restriction settings is available [here](https://smilecdr.com/docs/configuration_categories/tls_ssl_encryption.html#property-tls-cipher-blacklist)
