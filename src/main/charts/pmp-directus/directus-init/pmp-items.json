If you decide to create a PHN, the information contained within is not reviewed by the Plan or shared to any other group or individual. The information contained within is not in any way associated with or used to determine benefits, coverage, or premiums.\n\nYour PHN record is your personalized health record and contains a wide array of information for each member. Your PHN may contain medical information or results from health care services that do not represent a covered service or benefit of the NALC Plan. One such example would be collecting or claim services for information related to routine blood typing tests. The NALC Health Benefit Plan for Group and Employees provides this PHN tool to assist its members in managing their healthcare records, regardless of the Plan benefit coverage being provided.

The estimates are based on certain factors, potentially including contract rates, fee schedule, and/or claims averages. The average geographic cost estimates are based on average costs for in-network providers within the specific geographic market.</p>\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Your actual costs may be higher or lower than the estimate for various reasons, including but not limited to:</p>\n<ul class=\"text-justify\">\n<li>Application of copays, deductibles, and coinsurance amounts;</li>\n<li>Your unique medical circumstances and the decisions made by you and your health care professionals as to what services you will receive; if the services you receive are different from the services in the care path, the cost estimates based on the care path may vary from the cost for the services you receive;</li>\n<li>Where you receive services (for instance, if you receive services in a hospital and your estimate was based on services received in a healthcare provider's office or outpatient facility, the services may cost more than the estimate);</li>\n<li>If you change plans or enter a new plan year between the time you get the estimate and when you actually receive health care services;</li>\n<li>Even within a given plan year for a given benefit plan, your benefit plan information (such as your outstanding deductible or whether you have satisfied your out-of-pocket maximum) may be impacted by health care services you have already received but for which we have not yet received or processed a claim;</li>\n<li>Changes in the fee schedule or coverage, if your cost estimate is specific to a particular specific health care facility or professional (generally, it is more expensive for you to receive services from non-network facilities or professionals than from those who participate in network).</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Please note that other healthcare services may be provided to you that are medically necessary and appropriate as part of procedures for which you may have searched for an estimate, but of which you may not be aware at the time of your inquiry and for which you may have additional financial responsibility.</p>\n<p class=\"text-justify\">No Guarantee on Information Provided.&nbsp;You should refer to your coverage documents (Brochure) and contact the NALC Health Benefit Plan for Employees and Staff for details concerning your coverage, and you should contact your provider to confirm whether they are in-network. State, geographical, and area code variations may impact the estimates available through this site.</p>\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Costs Not Covered by the NALC Health Benefit Plan for Employees and Staff.&nbsp;You may be responsible for the cost of procedures or services, some of which may be covered in whole or in part or not at all by the NALC Health Benefit Plan for Employees and Staff.
